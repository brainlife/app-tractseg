Brainlife App for Automatic White Matter Bundle Segmentation using [MIC-DKFZ/TractSeg](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/TractSeg). A tool for fast and accurate white matter bundle segmentation from Diffusion MRI. 

[TractSeg](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2018.07.070) was developed by Jakob Wasserthal from Divison of Medical Image Computing at German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ). It uses pretrained 3D convolutional neural net implemented by pytorch to quickly identify white matter bungles.
